# Pair Mock Interviews Mod 1 Study Guide

It's never too early to practice solving coding challenges! This guide will help you get started. Please read through carefully and reach out for any clarifying questions.

## Before the interview

1. Choose who will start as the interviewer and who as the interviewee. You will switch after the first interview
2. The interviewer should choose a [trivia question](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Mock-Interview-Trivia-Questions/blob/main/README.md) and a [coding question](https://github.com/10-6-pursuit/mod_1_final_assessment_study_guide/blob/main/index.js)
3. If it's online meet at a Zoom room and have the interviewee share their screen on an empty replit or an empty whiteboard. If it's in person should find a whiteboard at the office or bring their own
4. The interviewer would Slack the question to the interviewee

## The "Interview"

This is not a real interview but the more seriously you take it the more value you can get out of it

1. The interviewer would asj the interviewee to tell them a little bit about themselves. Use this to practice your elevator pitch
1. The interviewer would ask the interviewee the trivia question first (2-3 minutes)
1. The interviewer would Slack the coding question in a dm to the interviewee
1. The interviewee would follow [these steps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lWxbJjU28OFxnKT5HrAizb5EbNtNUe87pta9tMpwHBo/edit?usp=sharing) to solve the coding challenge. If the interviewer isn't sure how to answer clarifying questions it's always good to say that they can expect only valid inputs. Feel free to also google or call for help. (20-25 minutes)

## After

1. The interviewer would provide feedback in the form of a compliment sandwich - Start and end with one good thing the interviewee did, and in the middle choose one thing they could work on. If possible provide actionable steps they can take.
2. Switch the roles and repeat


## Additional Notes

* You're not an aspiring software developer you ARE a Software Developer/Engineer
* As an interviewer you can give hints and be kind
* Remember, as an interviewee to always keep the conversation flowing. People want to see if they could work with you no their teams
* It's more important to show that you have an idea on how to solve a problem and approaching it methodically than actually getting your code running correctly as this point
